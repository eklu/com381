Standards-Based Web Design

Memo: Project 3
My enhancement was a site-wide lightbox for single images and for galleries also. There were some challenges in scaling and responsiveness, but I found those interesting. Currently due to differences in mobile browsers (rendering and resolution), the lightbox will only be working for tablets and desktops.

Memo: Project 2
Well, this one took a while. I never realized how much impact little things like 10 pixels of space had on the entire view of a website. Content development was also a challenge, writing a lot of pages about myself essentially. In the future, I hope to add more graphics to add some imagery and color.

Memo: Project 1

Coming into the class I had a pretty good knowledge of web development, but since it was self-taught, I really had no structure. I always hacked things together. Only a few weeks into the class, I am really appreciating what structure does for websites. It does make things a lot simpler. From reading the books, I am also learning a lot about simplistic design, for which I am already a big proponent. So far, I've learned to write cleaner code as a developer, and also be able to identify stucture in my pages.

My project showcases my resume, and a portfolio of designs. I chose to use graphic designs because that's what I do on the side - design posters and marketing materials for major student organiations on campus.
