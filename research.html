      <h3>Cognitive Science</h3>
      <h4>Investigating and modeling a system for parsing, understanding and simulating metaphors using bodily feelings of space, path, movement, force and emotion.</h4>
      <p class="topic">with Peter H. Greene, Professor Emeritus at CS Department at IIT <span class="dates">Spring 2012 - present</span></p>
      <p>This is based on work by George Lakoff, Christine Johnson, Gilles Fauconnier, Roland Langacker, Stephen Kosslyn and Leonard Talmy in cognitive grammar, case-based reasoning, cognitive linguistics and force dynamics. The aim is to design an object oriented system that would store abstractions of core concepts that we identify, and have mechanisms to generate visual representations of metaphors using those concepts. We are studying data structures and organization systems that might be employed by systems, biological or artificial, that use body-based concepts in the style of cognitive linguistics, so that our information processing isn't being done by our three-pound meat computer alone, but directly by our whole body as well.</p>
      <p>Intelligent agents should use ideas people use to organize families of other ideas, allowing fast communication, and easy recognition of conclusions that current computers must deduce laboriously. People use abstractions that remove the need to intertwine general plans with details of their implementation, and recognize similarity between superficially different situations. People model trying to achieve a goal as moving along a path, and impediments to achieving it as opposiong forces; and we model activities as places or containers (the next step in the argument, get out of doing the dishes). </p>
      <p>If software agents think this way, we can tell them "If you run into an obstacle, try the following approaches if they don't work out, return to the thing you tried earlier, but leave out the first step." Try and return are abstract organizing ideas that, like mathematical abstractions, let us use the same kinds of reasoning for things that are overtly quite different (for example, returning to Chicago, returning to poliltics, and returning to the first topic, with naught in common but their common mapping to a spatial representation). And, because spatial maps can be represented in a visual shift-register buffer (and according to the extensive work of Stephen Kosslyn, are analogously represented in our brains) conclusions could be seen by fast visual scanning, rather than by laborious deduction.</p>

      <h3>Data Mining</h3>
      <h4>Evaluating data clustering algorithms</h4>
      <p class="topic">with Wai G. Yee, Assistant Professor at CS Department at IIT <span class="dates">Winter 2010</span></p>
      <p>It is a method  of unsupervised learning (automated), where machines use algorithms to group data such that data is similar and/or structured intra-cluster-wise but not related inter-cluster-wise. We evaluated hierarchical algorithms, and partitional algorithms like k-means, fuzzy c-means, and mixture of gaussians. We concluded that for relatively good clustering, hierarchical clustering must be done first, then partitioning, so that relationships can be found on different levels.</p>
