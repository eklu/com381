    <h3>Cost Estimation for Structural Engineers</h3>
      <p>I worked on this application for a civil engineering firm in Ethiopia. An application with an intuitive UI for cost estimation of structures - foundations, columns, beams and slabs. It is a complete suite that factors all the components of structures for cost estimation purposes. Features include multiple counts of components, and edit and delete features.<a href="https://github.com/eklu/costestimation">GitHub Repo</a>.<span class="topic">(Java, JavaFX, SceneBuilder)</span></p>

      <h3>Leadership Academy Website</h3>
      <p>I worked on a team of three to develop an MVC C# driven website for our scholarship academy at school. This website suppports event registration, scholarship candidate evaluation and user management. I worked mainly on design and the user interface. <a href="http://leadershipacademy.iit.edu">Visit the website</a>.<span class="topic">(MVC, C# .NET, HTML, CSS, Photoshop)</span></p>

      <h3>All Docs</h3>
      <p>This is currently in progress. It is a document/file viewer application for Windows 8. It allows you to view your combined files from cloud storage services. Services supported now are Box, Dropbox, SkyDrive and Google Drive. I am hoping to add support for Android, Windows Phone and iPhone. <a href="https://github.com/eklu/alldocs">GitHub Repo</a>.<span class="topic">(C#, XAML)</span></p>

      <h3>Koba</h3>
      <p>Koba is a fashion brand I'm working on with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/yeamlaksira-awol/24/244/7bb">Yeamlaksira Worku</a>, its founder. It is currently in the branding phase. The brand is inspired by Ethiopia, its rich culture, nature and beautiful people. We're looking forward to launching this brand soon.<span class="topic">(Photoshop, Illustrator)</span></p>

      <h3>EOD Robot</h3>
      <p>This was at the eXtreme Engineering Competition at the SHPE 2012 Conference. In a team of ten, and within 24 hours, we designed and built a functional prototype of a robot that would be used in safe bomb extraction in the military. I proposed the robot design and made marketing materials used at the presentation. I also built a functional website for the project for presentation purposes.<span class="topic">(Photoshop, HTML, CSS, Hardware)</span></p>

      <h3>Luau</h3>
      <p>This application was built with two other team members at the Fall 2012 hackathon at IIT. It is an event finder augmented reality application using the GPS and accelerometer of a smartphone. It was built as an android application using the Google Places API. It will be cleaned up in the future for other platforms. <a href="https://github.com/eklu/Luau">GitHub Repo</a>.<span class="topic">(Java)</span></p>

      <h3>4BYTE</h3>
      <p>I started this company in March 2008, while in high school in Ghana. It was essentially a media company that offered services in design and branding and web development. Products included magazines, t-shirts, letterheads, postage stamps, courier services and an electronic library management system. We serviced over 20 schools around the country and had a reputation of being awesome. The company is still active and serves as a design incubator for high school students in Ghana.<span class="topic">(Photoshop, Illustrator, CSS, HTML, PHP)</span></p>
