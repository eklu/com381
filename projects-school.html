      <h3>Belief Propagation in Social Networks</h3>
      <h4>InterProfessional Projects</h4>
      <p>I worked in a team of 10 to investigate the propagation of ideas in social networks, running sentiment analysis on feeds and identifying trends. Our scope was Twitter and the Elections 2012. Based on data retrieved, we predicted who would win the elections. I set up a server and managed a database to back the project. Also, I wrote the application to parse Twitter data and run sentiment analysis.<span class="topic">(Java, JavaScript)</span></p>

      <h3>GreenCents</h3>
      <h4>InterProfessional Projects</h4>
      <p>It was a mobile web application that would provide green alternatives to transportation. A native mobile application would later be developed using this prototype. Using Bing and Google Maps APIs, we were able to calculate routes and provide alternatives to transportation to reduce the carbon footprint and cut down costs. I helped design most of the user interface and interactions for the application.<span class="topic">(Photoshop, HTML)</span></p>

      <h3>Dynamic Memory Allocator</h3>
      <h4>Systems Programming</h4>
      <p>I wrote a dynamic storage allocator using explicit free lists. I reimplemented the malloc, free and realloc routines in the standard C library to achieve better throughput and space utilization. I followed a TDD approach in writing the application.<span class="topic">(C)</span></p>

      <h3>Appointment Scheduler</h3>
      <h4>Software Engineering</h4>
      <p>An appointment scheduler deployed as a widget. Allows for scheduling appointments for specified timeslots specified in the database. <a href="https://github.com/eklu/cs487">GitHub Repo</a>.<span class="topic">(Java, SaaS, SQL, Oracle)</span></p>

      <h3>Movie Theater Management System</h3>
      <h4>Database Management</h4>
      <p>A fully functional movie theater management system that supports customer management, employee management, theater managent and ticket management. Worked in a team of three to develop this. I wrote the backend code and all SQL scripts to interact with the database.<span class="topic">(C#, SQL, Oracle)</span></p>

      <h3>eSpark Learning</h3>
      <h4>MBA Business Strategies & Consulting</h4>
      <p>I served as a technical consultant in a group of consultants for eSpark Learning, an educational app developer. We conducted market research and product analysis and provided constructive feedback in improving the product. I conducted usability research, extensively tested the product, and reviewed the technologies being used in the company.</p>
