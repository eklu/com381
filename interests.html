        <h3>Travel</h3>
        <p>People hate being tourists, but I absolutely love the idea of backpacking. Since I started college, I have been to 21 of the 50 states, and DC. I have backpacked around western Europe - England, France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands - covering all the major cities. I am looking forward to exploring more of eastern Europe come summer 2013. I love nature and the amazing artchitecture here and around the world. An interesting fact is, I have not travelled to any other African country besides my homeland.</p>


        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>I love jazz, blues, christian and country music - pretty old school I know. I play the piano and know a little about the bass guitar. People ask what kind of music I play, and I tell them &quot;anything&quot;, but really, I play and contemporary christian music mostly. Unfortunately, I cannot read the staff and play simultaneously. I do read chord music sheets to play, but I mostly improvise and play by ear. I enjoy playing the piano in my free time and when I am stressed out. Hopefully I can play for charity someday.</p>


        <h3>Sports AND FITNESS</h3>
        <p>I follow basketball, soccer, football, and baseball sometimes. I'm a huge fan of the LA Lakers, Manchester United and Real Madrid. Of course, go White Sox! Sports I play soccer and basketball mostly. decent at a lot of other sports though - volleyball, ping-pong, and other random things. I really enjoy outdoor activities and watersports. I like running and working out also, while eating all my salads.</p>
